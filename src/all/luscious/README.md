## FAQ
#### Why is each page a Chapter?
New pages can always be added to a Luscious album by the creator of the album.

#### Why do i get the errors like `Index: 2, Size: 2`?
This happens when the manga is not supporting  your current resolution.

#### Why do features that require login not work even when im logged in?
Features that require login only work when the mirror is changed to the Members mirror.

#### Where did the other Luscious extensions go?
They are now mirror options in the Luscious extension.

#### Why are the animated images not loading?
For some `.gif` files when Luscious is resizing them they get turned in to `.jpg` files. Change your Image resolution to `Original`.
