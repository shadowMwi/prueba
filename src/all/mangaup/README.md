## FAQ

### Why chapters are missing in some titles?

Manga UP! have series with paid chapters. These will be filtered out from the chapter
list by default, even if you have bought then before. To read these chapters, use their
official app to purchase with their coin system and read there.

To check if a chapter is paid, open the WebView and check if the chapter thumbnail is
grayed out with a "Exclusive on app" warning or has an "Advanced" badge.
